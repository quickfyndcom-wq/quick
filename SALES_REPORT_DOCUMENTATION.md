### Database Schema

#### Product Model (Updated)
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  sku: String,
  price: Number,              // Selling price
  mrp: Number,                // MRP
  costPrice: Number,          // NEW: Actual cost/purchase price
  images: [String],
  inStock: Boolean,
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Order Model (Existing)
```javascript
{
  shortOrderNumber: Number,
  total: Number,              // Total revenue
  shippingFee: Number,        // Delivery cost
  orderItems: [{
    productId: ObjectId,
    quantity: Number,
    price: Number
  }],
  status: String,

  // ... other fields
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### 1. `/api/store/sales-report` (GET)
**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive sales report with profit/loss analysis

**Query Parameters:**
- `dateRange`: TODAY, YESTERDAY, THIS_WEEK, LAST_WEEK, THIS_MONTH, LAST_MONTH, THIS_YEAR, LAST_YEAR, CUSTOM
- `fromDate`: Start date (for CUSTOM range)
- `toDate`: End date (for CUSTOM range)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "report": {
    "totalRevenue": 150000,
    "totalCosts": 120000,
    "productCosts": 100000,
    "deliveryCosts": 20000,
    "marketingCosts": 0,
    "totalProfit": 30000,

    "avgOrderValue": 3000,
    "avgProfit": 600,
    "monthlyData": [...]
  },
  "orders": [...]
}
```

**Calculation Logic:**
```
For each order:
  orderProfit = orderRevenue - orderProductCost - orderDeliveryCost
  
  where:
  - orderRevenue = order.total
  - orderProductCost = Σ(product.costPrice × item.quantity)
  - orderDeliveryCost = order.shippingFee

totalProfit = totalRevenue - (totalProductCosts + totalDeliveryCosts + totalMarketingCosts)
profitMargin = (totalProfit / totalRevenue) × 100
```

#### 2. `/api/store/products/pricing` (GET)
**Purpose:** Fetch all products with pricing information

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,

## 📈 Profit Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Profitable Order
```
Product A:
  Selling Price: ₹999
  Cost Price: ₹500
  Quantity: 2
  
Order Details:
  Product Revenue: ₹999 × 2 = ₹1,998
  Product Cost: ₹500 × 2 = ₹1,000
  Delivery Charge: ₹50
  
Profit Calculation:
  Profit = ₹1,998 - ₹1,000 - ₹50 = ₹948
  Margin = (₹948 / ₹1,998) × 100 = 47.4%
```

### Example 2: Loss-Making Order
```
Product B:
  Selling Price: ₹299
  Cost Price: ₹250
  Quantity: 1
  
Order Details:
  Product Revenue: ₹299
  Product Cost: ₹250
  Delivery Charge: ₹99 (free shipping threshold not met)
  
Profit Calculation:
  Profit = ₹299 - ₹250 - ₹99 = -₹50 (Loss)
  Margin = (-₹50 / ₹299) × 100 = -16.7%
```

### Missing Cost Prices
- If a product doesn't have a cost price configured:
  - Order profit calculation treats product cost as ₹0
  - This may inflate reported profits
  - **Action required:** Configure cost prices for accurate reports

## 🔒 Security

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Profit showing as ₹0
**Solution:** Configure cost prices in Product Pricing page

### Issue: Orders not appearing in report
**Possible causes:**
1. Orders are cancelled → Excluded by design
2. Date range filter too narrow → Expand date range
3. No orders exist in selected period → Check order history

### Issue: Incorrect profit calculations
**Checklist:**
1. Verify all products have cost prices set
2. Check delivery charges are correct in orders
3. Ensure products aren't deleted (breaks productId reference)

### Issue: CSV export not working
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser popup blocker
2. Verify authentication token is valid
3. Try a different date range
